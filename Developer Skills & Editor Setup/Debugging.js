/* 
There is a four step Debugging Process to solve any bug:
1)  IDENTIFY -> Becoming aware that there iis a bug
2)  FIND -> Isolating where exactly the bug is happening in code
3)  FIX -> Correct the bug
4)  PREVENT -> Preventing it fromhappening again
*/

/*

# IDENTIFY
*   During Development
*   Testing software
*   User reports during production
*   Context: browsers, users ect

# FIND
*   Developer console (simple code) 
*   Debugger (complex code)

# FIX
*   Replace wrong solution with new correct solution

# PREVENT
*   Searching for the same bug in similar code
*   Writing tests using testing softwares
