    CLASS & ID

    # class and id are attribute used to name the element , later can be used across css and scss.
    # we also used id and class from javascript to do dumb manuplication.
    # we can use id and class to any elements.
    # each id has to be unique and can be used only once in a page. same class can be re-used across the page. 
    # I can have same class name multiple times in same page , but that is not the same with id .
    # It is a better practice to use classover id , when using it in css.
    # id naming convention => id="first-name", we use firstName or first_name in js. this is format for html id..

    SEMANTIC vs NON-SEMANTIC ELEMENTS
    Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain. 
    For example, tags like <header>, <article>, and <footer> are semantic HTML tags. 
    They clearly indicate the role of the content they contain. On the other hand, 
    tags like <div> and <span> are typical examples of non-semantic HTML elements.
