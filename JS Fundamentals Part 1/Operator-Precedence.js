/*------------------------------------------------------------*Operator precedence*------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*
Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.
Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).
*/

// execution of code will either happen from( left to right ) or ( right to left ) based on it sprecedence 
// the execution of code will happen based on the precedence value that is given to each operator. 
let x,y;
x = y = 25-10-5;
console.log(x,y);
//=> based on the precedense , subtraction will execute followed by ( = ).
// answer wil be x = y = 10 ðŸ§¾

//precedence of Grouping
const a = 10;
const b = 25;
const average = (a+b)/2;
console.log(average)
//=> based on the precedense , grouping will execute first, followed by ( / ) division.
// answer wil be x = y = 10 ðŸ§¾
