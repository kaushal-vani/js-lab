/*----------------------------------------------------------*Statement & Expression-----------------------------------------------------------*/
// Anything that has a value is called as an expression, for example 
const myName = "Kaushal" //=> this is an Expression , because when i call 'myName. it will return ()=> Kaushal,

// Where as in statemnet , it will not nessecary return a value , it helps use to process expression and return a value out of it 
// We can use an expression without a statement, but cannot use a statement without an expression.

if(myName){
    return 
}
// the above block is a statement.

// we can console.log an XPathExpression, but cannot log an statement
